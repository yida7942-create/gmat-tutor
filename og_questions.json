Unfortunately, corporations are oriented predominantly toward controlling employees, not fostering their learning. Ironically, this orientation creates the very conditions that predestine employees to mediocre performances. Over time, superior performance requires superior learning, because long-term corporate survival depends on continually exploring new business and organizational opportunities that can create new sources of growth. To survive in the future, corporations must become “learning organizations,” enterprises that are constantly able to adapt and expand their capabilities. To accomplish this, corporations must change how they view employees. The traditional view that a single charismatic leader should set the corporation’s direction and make key decisions is rooted in an individualistic worldview. In an increasingly interdependent world, such a view is no longer viable. In learning organizations, thinking and acting are integrated at all job levels. Corporate leadership is shared, and leaders become designers, teachers, and stewards, roles requiring new skills: the ability to build shared vision, to reveal and challenge prevailing mental models, and to foster broader, more integrated patterns of thinking.

An explanation for such changes was offered by “dilatancy theory,” based on a well-known phenomenon observed in rocks in the laboratory: as stress builds, microfractures in rock close, decreasing the rock’s volume. But as stress continues to increase, the rock begins to crack and expand in volume, allowing groundwater to seep in, weakening the rock.

According to a recent study of retail firms, which confirmed that IT has become pervasive and relatively easy to acquire, IT by itself appeared to have conferred little advantage. In fact, though little evidence of any direct effect was found, the frequent negative correlations between IT and performance suggested that IT had probably weakened some firms’ competitive positions. However, firms’ human resources, in and of themselves, did explain improved performance, and some firms gained IT-related advantages by merging IT with complementary resources, particularly human resources.

      "Ambivalent Line This passage is based on an article written in 2000. The traditional model of employer-employee relations in the United States was a “psychological contract” in which employees made long-term commitments to organizations in exchange for long-term job security, training and development, and internal opportunities for promotion. Beginning mainly with the recession in the early 1970s, this paradigm began to unravel. Organizations began using extensive downsizing and outsourcing to decrease the number of permanent employees in the workforce. Among employees, this situation has resulted in a decided shift in desire: instead of working their way up in an organization, many now prefer to work their way out. Entrepreneurship and small business administration are now the fastest\u0002growing majors in business schools. Several factors have generated movement from the old paradigm to the new one. Organizations have had legitimate and pressing reasons to shift to a new paradigm of employer-employee relations. Large numbers of permanent employees make it difficult for organizations to respond quickly to downturns in demand by decreasing payroll costs. The enormous rise in wrongful discharge suits has created incentives for organizations to use temporary, contract, and leased employees in order to distance themselves from potential litigation problems. Moreover, top management is under increased pressure from shareholders to generate higher and higher levels of return on investment in the short run, resulting in declines in hiring, increases in layoffs, and shortage of funds for employee development. At the same time, a lack of forthrightness on the part of organizations has led to increased cynicism among employees about management’s motivation and competence. Employees are now working 15 percent more hours per week than they were 20 years ago, but organizations acknowledge this fact only by running stress-management workshops to help employees to cope. Salespeople are being asked to increase sales at the same time organizations have cut travel, phone, and advertising budgets. Employees could probably cope effectively with changes in the psychological contract if organizations were more forthright about how they were changing it. But the euphemistic jargon used by executives to justify the changes they are implementing frequently backfires; rather than engendering sympathy for management’s position, it sparks employees’ desire to be free of the organization altogether. In a recent study of employees’ attitudes about management, 49 percent of the sample strongly agreed that “management will take advantage of you if given the chance.”"

Questions 45 to 100 — Difficulty: Medium Line The dry mountain ranges of the western United States contain rocks dating back 440 to 510 million years, to the Ordovician period, and teeming with evidence of tropical marine life. This rock record provides clues about one of the most significant radiations (periods when existing life-forms gave rise to variations that would eventually evolve into entirely new species) in the history of marine invertebrates. During this radiation the number of marine biological families increased greatly, and these families included species that would dominate the marine ecosystems of the area for the next 215 million years. Although the radiation spanned tens of millions of years, major changes in many species occurred during a geologically short time span within the radiation and, furthermore, appear to have occurred worldwide, suggesting that external events were major factors in the radiation. In fact, there is evidence of major ecological and geological changes during this period: the sea level dropped drastically and mountain ranges were formed. In this instance, rather than leading to large-scale extinctions, these kinds of environmental changes may have resulted in an enriched pattern of habitats and nutrients, which in turn gave rise to the Ordovician radiation. However, the actual relationship between these environmental factors and the diversification of life-forms is not yet fully understood"

The productive contributions of workers and capital goods cannot be compared because the productive life span of capital goods is longer than that of workers. B. The author’s analysis of the distribution of income is misleading because only a small percentage of workers are also shareholders. C. Capital goods are valuable only insofar as they contribute directly to the production of consumer goods. D. The productive contribution of capital goods must be discounted because capital goods require maintenance. E. The productive contribution of capital goods must be attributed to labor because capital goods are themselves products of labor. 53. The author of the passage implies which of the following regarding the formulators of the labor theory of value? A. They came from a working-class background. B. Their views were too radical to have popular appeal. C. At least one of them was a close contemporary of Locke. D. They were familiar with Locke’s views on the relationship between labor and the value of products. E. They underestimated the importance of consumer goods in a modern economy. Line Exactly when in the early modern era Native Americans began exchanging animal furs with Europeans for European-made goods is uncertain. What is fairly certain, even though they left no written evidence of having done so, is that the first Europeans to conduct such trade during the modern period were fishing crews working the waters around Newfoundland. Archaeologists had noticed that sixteenth-century Native American sites were strewn with iron bolts and metal pins. Only later, upon reading Nicolas Denys’s 1672 account of seventeenth-century European settlements in North America, did archaeologists realize that sixteenth-century European fishing crews had dismantled and exchanged parts of their ships for furs. By the time Europeans sailing the Atlantic coast of North America first documented the fur trade, it was apparently well underway. The first to record such trade—the captain of a Portuguese vessel sailing from Newfoundland in 1501—observed that a Native American aboard the ship wore Venetian silver earrings. Another early chronicler noted in 1524 that Native Americans living along the coast of what is now New England had become selective about European trade goods: they accepted only knives, fishhooks, and sharp metal. By the time Cartier sailed the Saint Lawrence River ten years later, Native Americans had traded with Europeans for more than thirty years, perhaps half a century.\n\nThe passage suggests which of the following about the sixteenth-century Native Americans who traded with Europeans on the coast of what is now called New England?",

When the biological species concept is difficult to apply, some investigators use phenotype, an organism’s observable characteristics, instead.

Line Determining whether a given population of animals constitutes a distinct species can be difficult because no single accepted definition of the term exists. One approach, called the biological species concept, bases the definition on reproductive compatibility. According to this view, a species is a group of animals that can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring but cannot mate successfully with members of a different group. Yet this idea can be too restrictive. First, mating between groups labeled as different species (hybridization), as often occurs in the canine family, is quite common in nature. Second, sometimes the differences between two populations might not prevent them from interbreeding, even though they are dissimilar in traits unrelated to reproduction; some biologists question whether such disparate groups should be considered a single species. A third problem with the biological species concept is that investigators cannot always determine whether two groups that live in different places are capable of interbreeding. When the biological species concept is difficult to apply, some investigators use phenotype, an organism’s observable characteristics, instead. Two groups that have evolved separately are likely to display measurable differences in many of their traits, such as skull size or width of teeth. If the distribution of measurements from one group does not overlap with those of another, the two groups might reasonably be considered distinct species.",

In the first place, most behaviors are governed by more than one gene, and until recently geneticists had no method for identifying the multiple genes involved. In addition, even when a single gene is found to control a behavior, researchers in different fields do not necessarily agree that it is a “behavioral gene.” Neuroscientists, whose interest in genetic research is to understand the nervous system (which generates behavior), define the term broadly. But ethologists—specialists in animal behavior—are interested in evolution, so they define the term narrowly. They insist that mutations in a behavioral gene must alter a specific normal behavior and not merely make the organism ill, so that the genetically induced behavioral change will provide variation that natural selection can act upon, possibly leading to the evolution of a new species. For example, in the fruit fly, researchers have identified the gene Shaker, mutations in which cause flies to shake violently under anesthesia. Since shaking is not healthy, ethologists do not consider Shaker a behavioral gene. In contrast, ethologists do consider the gene period (per), which controls the fruit fly’s circadian (24-hour) rhythm, a behavioral gene because flies with mutated per genes are healthy; they simply have different rhythms"

Line For most species of animals, the number of individuals in the species is inversely proportional to the average body size for members of the species: the smaller the body size, the larger the number of individual animals. The tamarin, a small South American monkey, breaks this rule. Of the ten primate species studied in Peru’s Manu National Park, for example, the two species of tamarins, saddle-backed and emperor, are the eighth and ninth least abundant, respectively. Only the pygmy marmoset, which is even smaller, is less abundant. The tamarin’s scarcity is not easily explained; it cannot be dismissed as a consequence of diet, because tamarins feed on the same mixture of fruit, nectar, and small prey as do several of their more numerous larger counterparts, including the two capuchins known as the squirrel monkey and the night monkey. Although the relative proportions of fruits consumed varies somewhat among species, it is hard to imagine that such subtle differences are crucial to understanding the relative rarity of tamarins. To emphasize just how anomalously rare tamarins are, we can compare them to the other omnivorous primates in the community. In terms of numbers of individuals per square kilometer, they rank well below the two capuchins, the squirrel monkey and the night monkey. And in terms of biomass, or the total weight of the individuals that occupy a unit area of habitat, each tamarin species is present at only one-twentieth the mass of brown capuchins or one-tenth that of squirrel monkeys. To gain another perspective, consider the spatial requirements of tamarins. Tamarins are rigidly territorial, vigorously expelling any intruders that may stray within the sharply defined boundaries of their domains. Groups invest an appreciable part of their time and energy in patrolling their territorial boundaries, announcing their presence to their neighbors with shrill, sweeping cries. Such concerted territoriality is rather exceptional among primates, though the gibbons and siamangs of Asia show it, as do a few other New World species such as the titi and night monkeys. What is most surprising about tamarin territories is their size. Titi monkeys routinely live within territories of 6 to 8 hectares, and night monkeys seldom defend more than 10 hectares, but tamarin groups routinely occupy areas of 30 to 120 hectares. Contrast this with the 1 to 2 hectares needed by the common North American gray squirrel, a nonterritorial mammal of about the same size. A group of tamarins uses about as much space as a troop of brown capuchins, though the latter weighs 15 times as much. Thus, in addition to being rare, tamarins require an amount of space that seems completely out of proportion to their size"

Wage-related concessions have come under particular attack, since opponents believe that high union wages underlay much of the success of United States industry in this century. They point out that a long-standing principle, shared by both management and labor, has been that workers should earn wages that give them the income they need to buy what they make. Moreover, high wages have given workers the buying power to propel the economy forward. If proposals for pay cuts, two-tier wage systems, and subminimum wages for young workers continue to gain credence, opponents believe the U.S. social structure will move toward that of a less-developed nation: a small group of wealthy investors, a sizable but still minority bloc of elite professionals and highly skilled employees, and a huge mass of marginal workers and unskilled laborers. Further, they argue that if unions willingly engage in concession bargaining on the false grounds that labor costs are the source of a company’s problems, unions will find themselves competing with Third World pay levels—a competition they cannot win.",

      "Explain domestic economic developments in terms of worldwide trends. Line Historians who study European women of the Renaissance try to measure “independence,” “options,” and other indicators of the degree to which the expression of women’s individuality was either permitted or suppressed. Influenced by Western individualism, these historians define a peculiar form of personhood: an innately bounded unit, autonomous and standing apart from both nature and society. An anthropologist, however, would contend that a person can be conceived in ways other than as an “individual.” In many societies a person’s identity is not intrinsically unique and self-contained but instead is defined within a complex web of social relationships. In her study of the fifteenth-century Florentine widow Alessandra Strozzi, a historian who specializes in European women of the Renaissance attributes individual intention and authorship of actions to her subject. This historian assumes that Alessandra had goals and interests different from those of her sons, yet much of the historian’s own research reveals that Alessandra acted primarily as a champion of her sons’ interests, taking their goals as her own. Thus Alessandra conforms more closely to the anthropologist’s notion that personal motivation is embedded in a social context. Indeed, one could argue that Alessandra did not distinguish her personhood from that of her sons. In Renaissance Europe the boundaries of the conceptual self were not always firm and closed and did not necessarily coincide with the boundaries of the bodily self"

In his study of the Lone Wolf case, Blue Clark properly emphasizes the Court’s assertion of a virtually unlimited unilateral power of Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate) over Native American affairs. But he fails to note the decision’s more far-reaching impact: shortly after Lone Wolf, the federal government totally abandoned negotiation and execution of formal written agreements with Indian tribes as a prerequisite for the implementation of federal Indian policy. Many commentators believe that this change had already occurred in 1871 when—following a dispute between the House and the Senate over which chamber should enjoy primacy in Indian affairs—Congress abolished the making of treaties with Native American tribes. But in reality, the federal government continued to negotiate formal tribal agreements past the turn of the century, treating these documents not as treaties with sovereign nations requiring ratification by the Senate but simply as legislation to be passed by both houses of Congress. The Lone Wolf decision ended this era of formal negotiation and finally did away with what had increasingly become the empty formality of obtaining tribal consent"

Like many other industries, the travel industry is under increasing pressure to expand globally in order to keep pace with its corporate customers, who have globalized their operations in response to market pressure, competitor actions, and changing supplier relations. But it is difficult for service organizations to globalize. Global expansion through acquisition is usually expensive, and expansion through internal growth is time-consuming and sometimes impossible in markets that are not actively growing. Some service industry companies, in fact, regard these traditional routes to global expansion as inappropriate for service industries because of their special need to preserve local responsiveness through local presence and expertise. One travel agency has eschewed the traditional route altogether. A survivor of the changes that swept the travel industry as a result of the deregulation of the airlines in 1978—changes that included dramatic growth in the corporate demand for travel services, as well as extensive restructuring and consolidation within the travel industry—this agency adopted a unique structure for globalization. Rather than expand by attempting to develop its own offices abroad, which would require the development of local travel management expertise sufficient to capture foreign markets, the company solved its globalization dilemma effectively by forging alliances with the best foreign partners it could find. The resulting cooperative alliance of independent agencies now comprises 32 partners spanning 37 countries"

Possibly as numerous as conventional galaxies, these galaxies have the same general shape and even the same approximate number of stars as a common type of conventional galaxy, the spiral, but tend to be much larger. Because these galaxies’ mass is spread out over larger areas, they have far fewer stars per unit volume than do conventional galaxies. Apparently these low-surface-brightness galaxies, as they are called, take much longer than conventional galaxies to condense their primordial gas and convert it to stars—that is, they evolve much more slowly. These galaxies may constitute an answer to the long-standing puzzle of the missing baryonic mass in the universe. Baryons—subatomic particles that are generally protons or neutrons—are the source of stellar, and therefore galactic, luminosity, and so their numbers can be estimated based on how luminous galaxies are. However, the amount of helium in the universe, as measured by spectroscopy, suggests that there are far more baryons in the universe than estimates based on galactic luminosity indicate.

These novels’ favorable portrayal of such women is noteworthy, since Mexican-American historians have concluded that unflattering literary depictions of Mexicans were vital in rallying the United States public’s support for the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). The importance of economic alliances forged through marriages with Californianas explains this apparent contradiction. Because of their real\u0002life economic significance, the Californianas were portrayed more favorably than were others of the same nationality.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would provide the most support for Castañeda’s explanation of the “stereotypical plot” mentioned in the lines 18–19?",

As Castañeda notes, scholars of women’s history observe that in the United States, male novelists of the period—during which, according to these scholars, women’s traditional economic role in home-based agriculture was threatened by the transition to a factory-based industrial economy— define women solely in their domestic roles of wife and mother.

Scientists have been puzzled by the seeming disparity between models of global warming based on greenhouse gas emissions and actual climatological data. In short, the world is not warming up as much as these models have predicted. In the early 1990s, Pat Michaels sought to explain this disparity, suggesting that sulfate emissions in industrial areas had a cooling effect, thus temporarily retarding global warming. Michaels later came to doubt this idea, however, pointing out that since most sulfate is emitted in the Northern Hemisphere, its cooling influence should be largely limited to that hemisphere. Yet, since 1987, warming in the Southern Hemisphere, which had been relatively intense, has virtually ceased, while warming in the north has accelerated. Thus, Michaels not only doubted the idea of sulfate cooling, but came to feel that global warming models themselves may be flawed. Ben Santer disagrees. Santer contends that, in general, global warming occurs more slowly in the south because this hemisphere is dominated by oceans, which warm more slowly than the landmasses that dominate the Northern Hemisphere. But, according to Santer, the situation remains complicated by sulfate cooling, which peaked in the north in the mid-twentieth century. It drastically slowed warming in the Northern Hemisphere, and warming in the Southern Hemisphere raced ahead. Since 1987, Santer argues, the greenhouse effect has reasserted itself, and the north has taken the lead. Thus, Santer disputes Michaels’s claim that model predictions and observed data differ fundamentally"

He also disputes Szalay’s suggestion that the heavy enamel of australopithecine teeth is an adaptation to bone crunching, since both seed cracking and bone crunching produce distinctive micro-wear characteristics on teeth. His conclusion that australopithecines were frugivores (fruit eaters) is based upon his observation that the tooth micro\u0002wear characteristics of east African australopithecine specimens are indistinguishable from those of chimpanzees and orangutans, which are commonly assumed to be frugivorous primates. However, research on the diets of contemporary primates suggests that micro-wear studies may have limited utility in determining the foods that are actually eaten. For example, insect eating, which can cause distinct micro-wear patterns, would not cause much tooth abrasion in modern baboons, who eat only soft-bodied insects rather than hard-bodied insects.

The history of women’s work in English farmhouse cheese making between 1800 and 1930 is a case in point. In her influential Women Workers and the Industrial Revolution (1930), Pinchbeck argued that the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with its attendant specialization and enlarged scale of operation, curtailed women’s participation in the business of cheese production. Earlier, she maintained, women had concerned themselves with feeding cows, rearing calves, and even selling the cheese in local markets and fairs. Pinchbeck thought that the advent of specialization meant that women’s work in cheese dairying was reduced simply to processing the milk. “Dairymen” (a new social category) raised and fed cows and sold the cheese through factors, who were also men. With this narrowing of the scope of work, Pinchbeck believed, women lost business ability, independence, and initiative. Though Pinchbeck portrayed precapitalist, preindustrial conditions as superior to what followed, recent scholarship has seriously questioned the notion of a golden age for women in precapitalist society. For example, scholars note that women’s control seldom extended to the disposal of the proceeds of their work. In the case of cheese, the rise of factors may have compromised women’s ability to market cheese at fairs. But merely selling the cheese did not necessarily imply access to the money: Davidoff cites the case of an Essex man who appropriated all but a fraction of the money from his wife’s cheese sales. By focusing on somewhat peripheral operations, moreover, Pinchbeck missed a substantial element of continuity in women’s participation: throughout the period women did the central work of actually making cheese. Their persistence in English cheese dairying contrasts with women’s early disappearance from arable agriculture in southeast England and from American cheese dairying. Comparing these three divergent developments yields some reasons for the differences among them. English cheese\u0002making women worked in a setting in which cultural values, agricultural conditions, and the nature of their work combined to support their continued participation. In the other cases, one or more of these elements was lacking.\n\nRegarding English local markets and fairs, which of the following can be inferred from the passage?",

Comparing these three divergent developments yields some reasons for the differences among them. English cheese\u0002making women worked in a setting in which cultural values, agricultural conditions, and the nature of their work combined to support their continued participation.

Flyna has set up a certification scheme for lumber mills. Specialized staff make surprise visits to Country X mills, inspect documentation to ensure that the wood supply has a legal origin, and certify mills as approved sources for legally obtained lumber. Flyna uses only lumber from certified mills. According to the argument, Flyna’s claim that its wood supply is legally obtained is justified.\n\nReasoning: What additional information would, if true, most undermine the justification for Flyna’ claim that its Country X wood is legally obtained? Clearly, much depends on the thoroughness of the certification scheme. For example, the staff auditing the mills would need to be qualified for the job and meticulous in meeting their responsibilities. The auditing visits would need to be frequent enough, and not predictable by mill management. Flyna would need to be genuinely committed to ensuring legality of wood sources; it would need to monitor its staff to ensure that they were doing their jobs effectively.\n\nWhy D is correct: This means that 90 percent of Country X’s certified lumber mills are not inspected in any particular year. Moreover, since the selection of the 10 percent of lumber mills to be inspected in a given year is random, some lumber mills might go for much longer than ten years without inspection; during this period, many of those mills might fall below certification standards and even use lumber illegally obtained."

On (1), insurance companies pay less for XCTs than for ZNKs. On (2), insurance companies pay more for repairing XCTs than ZNKs. An insurance expert explains that repairs to XCTs are especially labor-intensive; this tends to raise the cost of repairs.\n\nReasoning: Which piece of new information most strongly supports the expert’s explanation for the fact that the replacement value is greater for the car that has lower repair costs? We should look for information that supplements the explanation in a way that shows the coherence of the two facts given regarding insurance payments for the two cars.\n\nWhy D is correct: ZNKs are more valuable because buyers know that total repair costs will be lower. This is reflected in the market value of ZNKs compared to that of XCTs. Replacing a stolen XCT costs insurance companies less than replacing a stolen ZNK because the lower market value of XCTs is related in the high cost of collision repair."

In addition, the pests that survive the application of the pesticide may become resistant to it, and these pesticide-resistant pests will continue breeding.\n\nReasoning: What can be done to prolong the effectiveness of pesticide use? It can be inferred that the ongoing use of a particular pesticide will not continue to be effective against the future generations of pests with an inherent resistance to that pesticide. What would be effective against these future generations? If farmers periodically change the particular pesticide they use, then pests resistant to one kind of pesticide might be killed by another. This would continue, with pests being killed off in cycles as the pesticides are changed. It is also possible that this rotation might allow some of the pests’ natural enemies to survive, at least until the next cycle.\n\nWhy B is correct: This statement properly identifies an action that could extend the effectiveness of pesticide use."

We are told that climate, amount of traffic, and the size and weight of vehicles on a road affect how quickly the road wears. We are also told that the amounts of traffic on the two sides of the highway are almost identical. Probably the climate on the two sides is also almost identical.

The Maranian government plans to ban within the next two years the use of diesel engines with more than 80 percent of current diesel engine particulate emissions in Marania, and Onez will probably not be able to retool its engine to reduce emissions to reach this target.

    "explanation": "Situation: Two companies, Ythex and Onez, produce diesel engines in Marania. Ythex has developed a small engine that produces less particulate pollution than the engine made by Onez, its main rival. The Maranian government will put a new maximum particulate-emission level in force within two years, but Onez will not be able to meet this target.\n\nReasoning: What would have to be assumed for the argument to support the prediction that Ythex’s engine will sell well in two years when the new maximum particulate level is introduced? To answer this, one might ask, for example: Will the maximum level be efficiently enforced? Will Ythex have any rivals other than Onez that will compete in the low-pollution diesel market?\n\nWhy E is correct: Are there one or more diesel engines from other companies that will be able to compete effectively with Ythex’s engine when the ban is introduced? For the reasoning to be logically compelling, it needs to be assumed that the answer is no."

Even though sweet potatoes are a staple of the region and the body can convert a sweet potato’s beta-carotene into vitamin A, the varieties currently grown there contain little beta-carotene.\n\nReasoning: What would most support the success of the plan to improve nutrition by encouraging farmers to plant SPK004? What, that is, would make farmers respond positively to encouragement to plant SPK004? Farmers in the region would probably be inclined to substitute SPK004 for the varieties of sweet potato they currently grow if they could be assured that SPK004 would grow as well as those other varieties do. This would in turn most likely lead to SPK004 being substituted for current varieties of sweet potato in staple dishes, and thus to an improvement in nutrition in the region.\n\nWhy A is correct: This statement properly identifies a factor that would support a prediction of the plan’s success."

    "explanation": "Situation: Super Express, a shipping company, is concerned that a new level of efficiency in its delivery process, resulting in next-day delivery even with guaranteed two-day delivery, might sabotage the company’s more expensive “premium” next-day delivery service. To promote the premium delivery service, the company plans to delay, for one day, two-day delivery packages that arrive one day early at a center near the customer and could be delivered that same day.\n\nReasoning: What does the company’s plan assume? The company’s rationale for its plan is that without the planned delay, its next-day premium service would lose revenue if potential customers realized that the less expensive two-day delivery service usually results in next-day delivery. So the plan must assume that the planned delivery day will not damage the company’s image in a way that would cause significant loss of customers.\n\nWhy A is correct: If it became public that the company was deliberately delaying packages, its brand and reputation would likely suffer major damage and its ability to promote its services—including its premium next-day delivery service—would probably be seriously impaired. Since presumably the company wants to retain existing customers and even attract new ones, its plan (including the rationale for it) would not make sense unless it were assumed that such catastrophic consequences would not result."

    "explanation": "Situation: Cocoa grown organically under the rain forest canopy can obtain a price premium of 30 percent for the grower. But the certification needed for the cocoa to be sold as organic is time-consuming and laborious. Since cocoa grown in full sun by standard (non-organic) techniques can have twice the yield, it is concluded that standard techniques are better financially for the farmer.\n\nReasoning: Among the pieces of information presented, which one, assuming it is accurate, would most weaken the argument if added to the given information? Specific information about the costs associated with growing cocoa using standard techniques is lacking in the given information. For example, does use of the “standard techniques” entail lower or higher costs than use of organic techniques? If we had information that the costs are much higher, such information would tend to weaken the argument—unless we also knew that the much higher yields more than compensate for the much higher costs. If we had information that consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about chemical residues in cocoa, that information would also tend to weaken the argument.\n\nWhy B is correct: This tells us that use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers entails very high costs for growers; moreover, such use of chemicals risks making the cocoa less attractive to consumers, ultimately impacting the grower’s financial benefits."

The researchers offered an answer to the following question in their conclusion: What caused some subjects not to volunteer again for another, similar experiment? The researchers concluded that one causal factor was having described an unethical action. This conclusion is based only on data about those who had described their unethical actions; the data showed that the hand washers among them were less likely to volunteer again than were those who did not wash their hands. This data, by itself, seems to provide at best weak support for the researchers’ conclusion. The hypothesis could be strengthened by data comparing those who had described their ethical actions with those who had described their unethical ones.\n\nWhy B is correct: This information does not refer to hand washing but provides a comparison between those who described an ethical action and those who described an unethical one, with respect to the likelihood of their volunteering for another, similar experiment. The fact that those who described ethical actions were more likely than the others to volunteer for subsequent experiments provides some evidence that describing an unethical action could have been a factor, along with the hand washing, that caused the observed difference in the volunteering rate. This additional evidence is only prima facie, though; it would be weakened if we also knew that among those who described ethical actions, the hand washers were just as unlikely to volunteer again as were those who washed their hands after describing unethical actions."

The diet of these farmers consisted mostly of the inexpensive grain corn, which lacked niacin in a form that can be absorbed by the body. However, when the cotton price collapsed during the Great Depression in the early 1930s, the incidence of pellagra decreased among these farmers.\n\nReasoning: What might explain the decline in incidence of pellagra among the cotton farmers during the Great Depression, despite the likelihood that the farmers would have experienced an increase in poverty? It may seem “curious” that a disease associated with malnutrition and poverty would become less common during a severe economic downturn. Our task is to find something that would explain this curious fact.\n\nWhy A is correct: The passage suggests that the pellagra of the farmers was due to their diet of mostly corn, which they purchased. However, this answer choice indicates that, during the time that the farmers grew much of their own food during the Great Depression, the diet of the farmers changed significantly and had greater variety. This point, together with the fact that pellagra among the farmers decreased during this time, suggests that the decrease in pellagra among the farmers was due to their growing their own food."

Even if leaders do not affect the success of the individuals they lead, they might still affect those individuals’ attitudes. And those attitudes in turn might affect group success. If so, the argument would be weak. So any evidence about the existence or strength of these possible effects in the relationship between supervisors and their supervisees would be helpful in evaluating the argument.\n\nWhy E is correct: As explained above, if individual supervisees’ attitudes affect group success, the argument would be weak.

Yet the annual number of deaths and injuries resulting from car accidents has not increased much, which is quite puzzling.\n\nReasoning: What factor could help explain the puzzlingfact that the increase in car accidents was not reflected in a similar increase in deaths and injuries from car accidents? One (but perhaps unlikely) possibility is that a significantly greater proportion of the recent annual number of car accidents consisted of merely minor accidents, unlike 30 years ago. Another possibility is that cars are currently much better engineered for driver and passenger safety than 30 years ago. Yet a third possibility is that the total number of people traveling by car— passengers and drivers—has not increased significantly despite the large increase in the number of cars. This would mean that the average occupancy of a car has greatly decreased; so, even though the number of car accidents has significantly increased, the average number of people per car involved in an accident would have decreased significantly. On average, this would mean significantly fewer deaths and injuries per accident.\n\nWhy B is correct: This implies that the average number of passengers per car accident is significantly less, and this helps explain why the total number of deaths and injuries has not increased significantly."

When pecan farmers have a large harvest, they tend to save some of the crop in refrigerated storage until the following year, hoping to get higher prices then. This year’s crop will be very small. But prices are not predicted to be significantly higher than last year.\n\nReasoning: What can most reasonably complete the argument by filling in the blank? In other words, what would be the best reason for the prediction about this year’s prices? This year’s prices will be determined by the total market supply of pecans; this will include not only freshly harvested pecans but also pecans that were kept in storage from last year’s harvest. Information about the relative size of last year’s harvest could be partial evidence for a prediction about this year’s prices.\n\nWhy B is correct: This tells us that there was probably an unprecedented quantity of pecans in refrigerated storage from last year, so it is likely that the market supply of pecans this year will be relatively normal despite the poor harvest. This means that this year’s prices will not be much higher than last year’s; last year, the total pecan harvest was enormous and market supply probably relatively large."

The argument observes that over the course of two decades there was a positive rather than a negative correlation between inflation on the one hand and savings and investment on the other. It infers from this that high rates of inflation do not tend to diminish people’s incentive to save and invest. Is this inference justified? Note that the claim that this argument is trying to discredit is not that high rates of inflation always diminished people’s incentive to save and invest. Rather, the claim is merely that high rates of inflation tend to do this. The argument overlooks the possibility that during the two decades in question other factors may have caused a positive correlation to briefly appear even if in general the correlation is negative.\n\nWhy B is correct: If these other factors, unrelated to the inflation rate, that operated in the 1980’s but not the 1970’s, created an even greater disincentive to savings and investment than high inflation rates provide, then those trends do not provide evidence about the general relationship among savings, investment, and inflation."

    "explanation": "Situation: Many office buildings designed to prevent outside air from entering have elevated levels of toxic substances in their interior air, but other such buildings similar in age, design, and ventilation do not.\n\nReasoning: What would help to explain the difference in air quality among buildings similar in age, design, and ventilation? If office buildings are designed to prevent outside air from entering, toxic substances emitted into the interior air might not be ventilated out quickly, and thus might become more concentrated inside the building. But if such toxic substances are not emitted into a building’s interior air in the first place, they will not become concentrated there, even if the building is poorly ventilated. So any factor that suggests why toxic substances are emitted into the interior air of some buildings but not others of similar age and design would help to explain the difference in the buildings’ air quality.\n\nWhy A is correct: Some buildings may have these types of furniture, carpets, and paint, while other buildings similar in age, design, and ventilation do not."

In the passage, the first sentence (the first boldfaced statement) is a generalization. The second sentence provides an example of the economies of scale mentioned in the first sentence, so it helps support the first sentence as a conclusion. In the third sentence, the word since indicates that the first clause is a premise supporting the second clause (the second boldfaced statement) as a conclusion. That conclusion itself provides another example of the economies of scale mentioned in the first sentence, so it also helps support that first sentence as a conclusion.\n\nWhy A is correct: As explained above, the first boldfaced statement is supported by the rest of the statements in the argument, so it is the main conclusion. The second boldfaced statement supports the first, but is itself a conclusion supported by the since clause preceding it."

City officials replied that widening the roads would increase average traffic speeds, which would improve the effectiveness of vehicles’ pollution-control devices.\n\nReasoning: What would most support the conclusion that the improved effectiveness of the pollution-control devices would be insufficient to prevent the increased traffic from increasing air pollution? The word since preceding the blank space at the end of the argument indicates that the space should be filled with a premise supporting the conclusion stated immediately before the since. To support this conclusion, we would need evidence that widening the roads and increasing traffic speeds would not improve the pollution-control devices’ effectiveness enough to compensate for the amount of added air pollution generated by the additional traffic on the widened roads.\n\nWhy C is correct: If most vehicles in the area lack air-pollution devices altogether or have ones that do not work, then it is highly questionable whether the greater efficiency of the few functioning devices would be sufficient to compensate for the increase in air pollution that would result from increased traffic."

    "explanation": "Situation: Xagor Corporation produces platinum, a rare metal vital to many industries. Xagor’s plant is in a country that will soon impose an export tax on platinum. The world market price of platinum is predicted to rise.\n\nReasoning: Which of the pieces of information given, if true, would most tend to confirm the prediction given? The conclusion of the argument is a causal prediction: the world market price of platinum will increase because of the export tax on platinum. The argument tells us that a wide range of industries need platinum, so the introduction of taxes on exported platinum would likely make that platinum more expensive for the importing industries. This, in turn, would likely raise the world market price of platinum. But what if those industries could get all their platinum from countries that did not tax platinum exports? Then the world market price might not rise if exports from those countries could adequately fulfill market demand.\n\nWhy C is correct: This information strengthens the support for the conclusion. It indicates that some platinum subject to the export tax will almost certainly be exported and will cost importers more than before. This would tend to cause the world market price of platinum to rise, especially since platinum producers in other countries could remain competitive and still raise their prices."

Although its scope extends to college seniors in general (and in a statistical sense goes far beyond the evidence provided in the given information), it is the best supported of the five because it deviates least from the information we have. It is a good inference that the students’ political re-orientation occurred as a result of the “experiences they have had while in college”—even if some of the truly mind-changing experiences were obtained in activities unrelated to their college life (e.g., speaking with fellow workers in a part-time restaurant job)."

    "explanation": "Situation: X believes that plastic packaging should be banned to reduce plastic waste in landfills, but Y argues that plastic packaging is essential for public safety because of the safety features offered by plastic.\n\nReasoning: What is the weak point in Y’s response to X’s proposal, based on the claim that plastic packaging is necessary for public safety? Since Y’s argument is that plastic packaging offers essential safety features and therefore should not be eliminated, Y’s argument would be undermined by information that those safety features could be provided without the use of plastic.\n\nWhy A is correct: Y’s argument states that plastic is essential for providing safety features, which would allow the argument to be refuted by any evidence that those features can be created with other materials."

Though converting the branches into wood chips costs the same whether done at the logging site or at the factory, the wood chips take up half the space that the branches take up before conversion.\n\nReasoning: What is most likely to be true if the cost of converting branches to wood chips is equal at the logging site and the factory, but the total volume of the branches is greatly reduced by converting them into wood chips? The information states that the cost of conversion is the same at both locations, so the significant variable is the reduced volume of the branches after conversion into chips.\n\nWhy D is correct: Since converting the branches into chips greatly reduces their total volume, it follows that shipping costs determined by volume would also be reduced if the conversion were done at the logging site."

Moreover, the two new systems are comparable in performance, price, and ease of use.\n\nReasoning: Since the systems developed by Gammatech and Aptron are similar in price and ease of use, what other factor supports the prediction that Aptron’s system is more likely to dominate the market? The statement predicts that Aptron’s system will dominate the market but implicitly rules out two explanations—price and ease of use—for that prediction. Therefore, there is likely to be another factor that justifies the prediction.\n\nWhy E is correct: If it is easier to convert to Aptron’s system than to Gammatech’s, which might include some conversions from an earlier Gammatech system to the newest Aptron system, that would provide a logical reason for the prediction that Aptron will be likely to dominate the market."

However, in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, these antibiotics do not fight infection effectively. Some scientists propose that the higher levels of salt in lungs affected by cystic fibrosis may be the cause of the antibiotics’ poor functioning.\n\nReasoning: What evidence adds support to the hypothesis that, since people with cystic fibrosis have normal levels of naturally occurring antibiotics in their lungs, but abnormally high salt concentrations in their lungs, the extra salt is responsible for weakening the antibiotic’s efficacy? People with cystic fibrosis are vulnerable to lung infections despite normal levels of natural antibiotics, so the hypothesis that higher-than-normal salt concentrations in their lungs interfere with the antibiotic is reasonable; however, that hypothesis requires additional support.\n\nWhy C is correct: If lung tissue from people with cystic fibrosis can fight infection in a low-salt environment, that would add support to the hypothesis that the high-salt environment present in their lungs reduces the effect of the antibiotics."

The proposed law would address this by prohibiting the clubs to have groups of more than three musicians playing at the club.\n\nReasoning: Which statement, if true, would be the strongest indication that the proposed law would fail to reduce the noise that residents complained of? The proposed limit on group size depends on the assumption that the music played by a group of three musicians or fewer would not be loud enough to bother Middletown’s residents. If this assumption is false, for example if some of the smaller groups felt a need to use powerful amplification, the proposed law would be unlikely to be eliminate the nuisance by reducing the noise sufficiently.\n\nWhy E is correct: This indicates that the size of a musical group generally has little impact on the volume of sound that the group produces.

    "explanation": "Situation: The ulna-bone enlargements often found on forearms of skeletons of Ice Age humans have led anthropologists to conclude that those humans frequently hunted by throwing spears and that this practice caused the bone enlargement.\n\nReasoning: Which of the additional pieces of information offered provide the weakest (if any) support for the anthropologists’ conclusion? A premise of the anthropologists’ reasoning is that many Ice Age humans developed enlarged ulna bones. Another premise is that the bone enlargements resulted from the stresses of habitual [spear] throwing. The anthropologists’ conclusion is that those Ice Age humans frequently hunted by throwing spears. Several of the five additional pieces of information provide additional support for the anthropologists’ conclusion.\n\nWhy D is correct: This information, if true, tends to weaken the support for the anthropologists’ conclusion. It vaguely suggests that diseases that were endemic in the Ice Age and caused bone damage might adequately explain the enlargement of ulna bones found in the archaeological evidence. If this were correct, then that bone enlargement could no longer be regarded as compelling evidence of spear-throwing."

    "explanation": "Situation: Members of the North Tarrytown town council argued for changing the town’s name to Sleepy Hollow (the name of a fictitious place in stories by early nineteenth-century author Washington Irving). The goal was to increase tourism.\n\nReasoning: What unstated assumption is required for the council members’ argument to be logically compelling? Their argument was that people who associate the name Sleepy Hollow with the author Washington Irving would come to visit the town because of that association. The resulting influx of tourists would provide additional spending that would “immediately” result in financial benefits for the town’s inhabitants. There would not be such immediate benefits if the additional spending did not outweigh the costs of the name change.\n\nWhy E is correct: To be logically successful, the council members’ reasoning requires that this be assumed. Part of the council members’ reasoning is that the proposed name change would “result immediately in financial benefits for the town’s inhabitants.” This result will not occur unless the immediate costs associated with implementing the change are less than the revenue accruing to the town’s inhabitants as a result. In the medium and long term, the name change could provide increased financial benefits to the town’s inhabitants, but the council members’ reasoning requires that those benefits flow immediately."

If the massaged babies are burning more calories than unmassaged babies through their extra activity, but are not consuming more calories in the form of milk, then how are they gaining more weight than the unmassaged babies?

The low flow favors rapid algae growth. However, in periods of extreme drought, algae populations drop.\n\nReasoning: What information would most help to explain the two contrasting trends in algae growth?

    "explanation": "Situation: The politician suggests that tariffs on trade between Mexico and the United States were reduced during a certain year and notes that, in the year after that year, the amount of United States goods shipped to Mexico doubled. It may seem from this that the decrease in tariffs, because they may have reduced the prices of United States goods to Mexican companies and consumers, caused Mexican companies and consumers to double their purchases of United States goods in the year after the reduction in tariffs. This might explain the doubling of shipments of goods to Mexico. However, the politician argues that the decrease in tariffs did not cause the purchase of United States goods by Mexican companies and consumers to double.\n\nReasoning: What possible facts would indicate that the decrease in tariffs may not have caused Mexican companies and consumers to double their purchases of United States goods? The task in this question is to complete an argument that purports to show that a certain inference—that sales of United States goods to companies and consumers in Mexico increased as a result of the tariff decrease—does not follow logically from the fact that shipments of United States goods to Mexico doubled after the decrease in tariffs. Although it is not necessary to show that sales of United States goods to companies and consumers in Mexico did not double, any statement that would significantly decrease the strength of this inference may provide a reasonable answer to our question.\n\nWhy B is correct: If the statement in this answer choice is true, then we cannot, on the basis of an increase in shipments of goods to Mexico, infer that these goods were purchased by Mexican companies and consumers. The statement thus directly supports the politician’s argument."

The argument implicitly reasons that because officers working on traffic enforcement can turn up evidence of serious crimes by searching cars that commit traffic violations, reassigning those officers would hinder police efforts to prevent serious crime, even if the officers were reassigned to work directly on serious crime. The argument could be strengthened by information suggesting that traffic enforcement may increase the probability that evidence relating to serious crimes will be discovered.\n\nWhy C is correct: This suggests that people committing serious crimes often commit traffic violations as well, increasing the likelihood that traffic enforcement officers will stop and search their cars and find evidence of those crimes."

Since children will experience almost no risk from the virus, vaccinating them first for their own sake appears unnecessary. However, individuals at no personal risk from a virus can still transmit it to more-vulnerable individuals. If children are especially likely to transmit the virus, it could be reasonable to vaccinate them first in order to protect others, including elderly people, by preventing the virus from spreading.\n\nWhy B is correct: This suggests that children are especially likely to transmit the virus even if it does not endanger them.

A teacher shortage will arise next academic year if the number of teachers needed will exceed the number of teachers employed.

    "explanation": "Situation: A recently excavated 4,000-year-old temple contains structures that point toward the positions at the summer solstice of both the rising sun and a constellation known in local culture as the Fox. Local mythology represents the fox as teaching people how to cultivate and irrigate plants.\n\nReasoning: What must be true in order for the argument’s premises to suggest that the temple was built to religiously represent the fox? The argument’s premises are all observations about current conditions: the current alignment at the summer solstice of the temple relative to the sunrise and to the constellation known as the Fox, the current local name for a constellation, and current local mythology. To support the conclusion about the temple’s original purpose, the argument has to assume that all these conditions may still be essentially the same as they were 4,000 years ago when the temple was built.\n\nWhy A is correct: If the constellation’s position at the summer solstice relative to the temple is different from what it was 4,000 years ago, the temple must not have been aligned to point toward it when it was built. In that case, the argument’s justification for associating the temple with that constellation and with the fox is undermined."

In order for the strategy to be effective, it must be economically feasible for farmers to raise chickens using the feed, and there must be enough consumer demand for chickens raised this way. So any information about factors likely to affect either the economic feasibility of raising the chickens or consumer demand for them could be helpful in determining how useful the feed would be.\n\nWhy A is correct: If chicken producers tried to market meat from capsaicin-fed chickens without knowing whether the taste is affected, they would risk alienating consumers. Of course, if they found that the taste is affected, they would then need to do further investigations to determine how consumers would likely respond to the difference. If consumers did not like the taste, this could negatively affect demand for the chickens. In that case, using the feed would not be an effective way to raise chickens for retail sale."

The policy involved giving children bookmarks as rewards for returning overdue books, while removing the fines that penalized the children for doing so.

Although the eggs fail to hatch if disturbed during their several weeks of incubation, the lizards guard the tunnels for only a few days after laying the eggs.\n\nReasoning: What would help to explain why the lizards have to guard their tunnels for only a few days? For the lizards to survive as a species, their behaviors must ensure that enough of their eggs hatch. Thus, they must successfully prevent enough of their eggs from being disturbed in the tunnels throughout the several weeks of incubation. If guarding the tunnels for only a few days accomplishes this, then some other factor must prevent the eggs from being disturbed during the remaining weeks. Evidence of any such factor would help to explain why the lizards do not have to guard the tunnels longer. For example, to protect the eggs without guarding them, the lizards might conceal the tunnel entrances after the first few days. Or animals likely to disturb the eggs might only be present for those first days, in which case there would be nothing for the lizards to guard against thereafter.\n\nWhy A is correct: This suggests that the only creatures likely to disturb the eggs are other lizards of the same species digging tunnels to lay their own eggs at around the same time. If so, each lizard can safely leave its eggs unguarded after a few days because all the other lizards will have finished digging."

Representatives of these banks have offered a justification of this practice, based on a claim that this difference in interest rates “simply covers the difference” in costs, to the banks, associated with these respective types of loans (loans associated with credit cards and consumer loans that are not associated with credit cards).\n\nReasoning: What additional facts would indicate a flaw in the bank representatives’ argument? Given the description of the bank representatives’ argument, we may assume that, by their estimation, the costs to banks associated with credit card debt are greater than the costs associated with other consumer loans. The representatives’ argument, that the difference in interest rates “simply covers” this difference in costs, may then be seen as an argument that all of the extra money that the banks collect from the higher interest rates is necessary if the banks are to cover this difference in costs. If we can find a fact whereby the ten percentage point difference is not necessary to cover the difference in costs, then we may be able to “call into question” the bank representatives’ argument.\n\nWhy C is correct: If two to three percent of the value of purchases made on credit cards goes to the issuing banks, then this money could be used to cover some of the difference in costs described by the bank representatives. The interest rates on credit cards could therefore be somewhat lower than they actually are, with the difference in costs nevertheless still fully covered. The difference in interest rates of ten percentage points may therefore not be necessary."

After all, some orthopedists— perhaps more experienced, better-trained, or employed at a facility with better staff or facilities—may be much better than others at judging ankle fractures.

The argument is that environmental standards requiring the best results that state-of-the-art technology can provide are unreasonably expensive relative to their benefits, so it would be reasonable instead to set environmental standards that take into account all present and future risks from contaminants. In order for the premise to support the conclusion, the environmental standards based on present and future risks would have to be less expensive relative to their benefits than the best results environmental standards are. Furthermore, setting the current and future risks environmental standards cannot be reasonable unless it is feasible to assess present and future risks as those standards require.\n\nWhy B is correct: If taking future risks into account were infeasible, then applying the current and future risks standards would also be infeasible. And setting those standards would be unreasonable if they could not feasibly be applied."

    "explanation": "Situation: This question presents a puzzling scenario and asks us to find a possible fact that could make the situation less puzzling. The scenario involves a study that was conducted a few decades ago on a certain group of older adults. Those with the weakest immune systems were much more likely to die within two years than were the other individuals in the study. However, among the individuals with the weakest immune systems, death was more often by heart disease, from which the immune system does not protect, than from cancer or infections, for which a strong immune system is protective.\n\nReasoning: For the participants in the study with the weakest immune systems, what might best explain the deaths that were not due to weakness of the immune system? We might expect that the people with the weakest immune systems would be more likely to die from diseases that a strong immune system would protect them from than from other diseases. An explanation of the deaths that were not due to weakness of the immune system would explain why this is not the case.\n\nWhy C is correct: This answer choice suggests that those with heart disease—which would not have been due to weakness of the immune system—would have nevertheless had a weaker immune system due to the administration of certain drugs. Those with heart disease may for this reason have been among those with the weakest immune systems. If the individuals with weak immune systems due to treatment for heart disease formed a large-enough portion of the patients with the weakest immune systems, then we would have an explanation for why those with the weakest immune systems were more likely to die from heart disease than from infections or cancer."

Apart from Alfred’s translations and law code, there are only two other extant works in the same dialect and from the same milieu.\n\nReasoning: How does the reasoning in the passage proceed? The first sentence presents a claim that is not disputed in the passage. The second sentence presents a historian’s argument. Implicitly citing the undisputed claim in the passage’s first sentence as evidence, the historian proposes an analogy between the law code and Alfred’s translations, arguing on the basis of this analogy that Alfred wrote the law code. The third sentence of the passage casts doubt on this analogy, pointing out that it could plausibly apply to texts that Alfred did not write. The fourth sentence suggests that too few extant texts are available as evidence to rule out the possibility raised in the third sentence. Thus, the third and fourth sentences are intended to undermine the historian’s argument.\n\nWhy B is correct: The passage’s third and fourth sentences question the plausibility of the historian’s assumption that no one but Alfred would have been likely to write a text whose language has more similarities to than differences from the language in Alfred’s translations."

However, although in recent years hunting has reduced the population of alligators in the region, the population of the prized freshwater fish species has declined. The annual number caught for human consumption has not increased.\n\nReasoning: What might explain the decline in the population of the prized fish species, despite both the decrease in population of another species that preys heavily on the prized fish and the lack of increase in fishing for the species for human consumption? The population of the fish species declined, despite both the presence of a factor that we might be expected to produce an increase in the population of the species and the absence of a factor that we might ordinarily expect to explain the decrease. This situation may seem puzzling, and we may thus wish to find an explanation for it.\n\nWhy D is correct: Despite the fact that alligators prey on the prized fish species, this statement describes a way in which the fish species may be dependent on the alligators, in such a way that a decline in the population of the alligators could contribute to a decline in the fish species."

The passage supports the plan by claiming that the machine would reduce labor costs by virtually eliminating weeding by hand. The correct answer choice will be one that adds to this support. Labor costs will be reduced only if the machine works well. The machine relies on shade of color to distinguish between weeds and crop plants.

Although large numbers of wolves were killed over the next five years, wolf attacks on sheep nonetheless increased.\n\nReasoning: Since Hylantia’s wolf population was presumably reduced by significant killing of wolves from 1910 to 1915, what other factor would help explain increasing wolf attacks on sheep during the same period? Hylantia’s reduction of its wolf population did not lead to the desired result of reducing wolf attacks on sheep, but on the contrary increased such attacks. Therefore, some additional factor should account for the unexpected increase.\n\nWhy C is correct: If the population of injured wolves with a limited ability to hunt wild prey greatly increased after 1910, that would help explain why wolves increased their attacks on easier prey such as sheep at that time."

Because other manufacturers have said they will do the same, lower wholesale prices will lead to higher cereal sales.\n\nReasoning: What additional factor would be likely to affect the argument that lower wholesale cereal prices will lead to higher cereal sales? To determine whether the lower wholesale cereal prices set by manufacturers will indeed lead to higher retail sales of cereal, it would be useful to determine if any other factors would be likely to interfere in the expected causative relation between lower wholesale prices and higher demand. Since the information specifies that the lower prices are wholesale, one variable that could affect the argument is retail pricing.\n\nWhy D is correct: If supermarkets failed to lower their retail prices to reflect the decrease in wholesale prices, retail sales and ultimately wholesale sales would probably not increase.

In a recent survey, most of the same people were asked to rank those activities again. Many ranked housework higher than they had ranked it in the first survey. Yet most claimed that housework had become less demanding of their time over the past twenty-five years. In light of the higher ranking of housework, this claim is initially puzzling.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice provides the best explanation for the apparent inconsistency between the two findings cited from the recent survey? A rise in the ranking of housework could occur either because the amount of time taken by housework increased or because the amount of time taken by one or more of the other categories declined over the twenty-five years. For example, suppose housework ranked fourth, i.e., lowest, in the first survey. If most of those surveyed had been fulltime employees twenty-five years ago, the category jobs would probably have ranked much higher than the category housework. But if those people were retired twenty-five years later, then the time demanded by jobs would be much less or even zero. Housework might then rank higher than jobs in the second survey even if it did not demand as many hours as it did previously.\n\nWhy C is correct: Housework could move up in the ranking if the category jobs, for example, had drastically declined in the ranking below even housework. As explained above, this could occur if many or most of those surveyed had been employed fulltime twenty-five years ago but had retired in the meantime; this would be consistent with a rise in the ranking of housework as well as a reduction in the proportion of total time spent on housework."

However, the argument indicates a flaw in the plan: Hasaria’s existing power plants will have significantly reduced generation capacity in fifteen years, the time it will take for the new plants to become operational."

The quotas would be enforced by inspectors who will estimate the number of fish brought into port by each boat.\n\nReasoning: What new information raises the most serious doubts about whether the plan would succeed if it is implemented? The quota restrictions could raise problems associated with enforcement, economic viability, and acceptance by those whose livelihood depends, directly or indirectly, on the fishing industry. The restrictions would be pointless and would not attain the goal of protecting fishing stocks unless they could be effectively enforced. Other issues would have to be resolved for the proposed quotas to pass into law.\n\nWhy E is correct: The information about the proposed quota system indicates that the fish catch of each boat is monitored only in port. Boats could circumvent the quota system by indiscriminately catching and letting die all available fish but discarding the least valuable fish out at sea before submitting to the inspections in port. The non-survival of this part of the catch could, over time, impair the recovery of the coastal fish populations."

The firm’s employees comprise 1 percent of all employees working in Metroburg.

As a city that collects taxes, Metroburg presumably has public-sector employees. The migration of jobs to a location outside the city will entail that the proportion of all those working in the city who are private-sector employees will decrease, and—all things being equal—this, in turn, will cause an increase in the proportion of all employees in the city that are public\u0002sector employees.

The library’s management plans to refit most of the photocopiers to accept copy cards that allow 50 copies to be made at 9 cents each. The administrators believe that the refit will not result in fewer copies being made.\n\nReasoning: Assuming that the administrators are right, which of the five predictions about the effect of the refit is most strongly supported by the information provided? Suppose that only one card were sold and only 45 copies were made with that card. Then the amount that the user paid per copy would be 10 cents. Whatever the number of cards sold, provided the number of copies made per card averages less than 45, then the average revenue per copy would be more than 10 cents. This would produce an increase in total revenue if the total number of photocopy uses were no less than in previous years. The greater the number of cards sold, the greater the increase in total revenues, provided that the usage per card averages less than 45 copies. The lower the average usage per card, the greater the increase in photocopy revenue. The information provided suggests that the number of cards sold will be considerable, given that most of the machines are being refitted with card readers (and may be usable only with card readers).\n\nWhy E is correct: Each card has a capacity of 50 copies, so 90 percent of that is 45 copies. If the total number of copies made in the library remains at least as great as before and utilization of each card averages less than 45, revenues will increase; the lower the average utilization, the greater the increase in revenue."

When the colony is young and relatively small, its foragers aggressively seek and defend food resources. But when the colony grows older and reaches a certain size, its foragers become less aggressive.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice is most strongly supported by the given information? Obviously, the survival of a colony can be jeopardized by encountering unusual environmental challenges. But the given information suggests that, provided no unusual threats to the colony’s survival are encountered, a colony’s life cycle is biologically determined by constraints of colony size and age. The behavior of the individual foragers is correlated with the age and size of the colony; how a forager behaves in a colony near its maximum limits of size and age is quite different from an individual forager’s behavior in the colony’s early years. The behaviors of individual foragers are highly coordinated; the patterns of behavior of the colony are not caused by individual behaviors of the worker ants.\n\nWhy D is correct: As explained, the given information suggests that, provided no unusual threats to a colony’s survival are encountered, its life cycle is biologically determined by constraints of colony size and age, not by the behavior of individual forager ants or groups of such ants. The given information suggests that the biological constraints on a colony’s size and longevity also determine behaviors of individual worker ants, who live about one year."

Some politicians have concluded from this that high taxes do not hinder national prosperity.\n\nReasoning: What is a significant weakness in the politicians’ reasoning? Many factors besides level of taxation are likely to affect economic growth and national prosperity—factors such as having a highly skilled labor force, being rich in a valuable natural resource, and having effective and efficient government. So it is likely that more than one such factor is needed to sufficiently explain any country’s level of economic growth or prosperity. A combination of such factors may be sufficient to outweigh any negative impact of high taxes on economic growth or national prosperity.\n\nWhy C is correct: Even though Country X, with unusually high taxes, has greater per-capita income than Country Y, which has much lower taxes, Country X’s high-tax regime may contribute to making the country’s per-capita income and national prosperity less than it would be with a low-tax regime. As explained earlier, many different factors can affect a country’s national prosperity; some non-tax factors, absent in Country Y, may be boosting Country X’s prosperity and compensating for some negative effects of its high-tax regime."

    "explanation": "Situation: Urban rail systems have been proposed to help solve traffic congestion in cities. But critics have cited data from many cities to argue that this approach is ineffective. In one U.S. city that increased its urban rail service, over 3,000 fewer commuters used rail when employment expanded by almost 100,000. But officials who favor urban rail have countered this example by claiming that commuters account for only 20 percent of urban travel in that city.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice most undermines the officials’ response to the claim that urban rail would be ineffective in relieving urban traffic congestion? Theoretically, urban rail service should help reduce traffic congestion by encouraging people to travel by train instead of by car. However, there is purported evidence that this approach is ineffective: In at least one city, an increase in the availability of rail service correlated with a decrease in the number of commuters traveling by rail, even though the total number of commuters apparently increased. Some officials object that in that city, commuters account for only 20 percent of urban travel. The officials’ point is presumably that even if there was a net decline in commuters using the rail system, there may have been an overall increase in the number of people who used rail instead of driving. However, the stated goal of building more rail systems is to reduce traffic congestion, not just to reduce the overall amount of urban car traffic. Even if commuting makes up only 20 percent of urban travel in the city in question, it might contribute disproportionately to traffic congestion, and if noncommuters typically use the rail system, commuting might even constitute most of the car traffic in the city. So a net movement of commuters from rail travel to car travel could be detrimental to the goal of alleviating traffic congestion even if a minority of urban travel is in the form of commuting.\n\nWhy C is correct: As explained above, the stated goal of building more rail systems is to reduce traffic congestion, not just to reduce the overall amount of urban car traffic. Even if commuting makes up only 20 percent of urban travel in the city in question, it might contribute disproportionately to traffic congestion, and if noncommuters typically use the rail system, commuting might even constitute most of the car traffic in the city. So a net movement of commuters from rail travel to car travel could be detrimental to the goal of alleviating traffic congestion even if a minority of urban travel is in the form of commuting."

It is reasonable to assume that constructing a large parking ramp within two blocks of downtown will involve a large capital investment, made even larger by the high cost of land so near to downtown. If a ramp slightly farther from downtown could equally well serve downtown shoppers, and given that people are also likely to need nonresidential parking in another location, building a ramp in the specific location mentioned by the mayor would not be necessary. Note also that even if providing significantly more parking for business customers were necessary for the survival of downtown businesses, it might not be sufficient.\n\nWhy C is correct: If this were true, a parking ramp four blocks from downtown would suffice to solve the downtown parking shortage. Therefore, the construction of a ramp exactly two blocks from downtown would not be necessary."

LED bulbs can last around 50,000 hours, about five times as long as CFL bulbs, though (at the time the passage was written) they cost more than five times as much as CFL bulbs.\n\nReasoning: What claim is most strongly supported by the given information? The information in the passage gives only one reason not to prefer LED bulbs over CFL bulbs— which last five times as long as CFL bulbs—namely, that LED bulbs are more than five times costlier. Because of the greater cost of LED bulbs, it might make economic sense simply to change CFL bulbs numerous times rather than to use the longer-lasting LED bulbs. If, however, there were any practical reason that outweighed that particular economic reason—perhaps the repeated replacement of CFL bulbs would be particularly problematic—then it might be wise to choose LED bulbs over CFL bulbs.\n\nWhy A is correct: In locations where replacing bulbs is particularly difficult and even costly, it would probably make sense to use LED bulbs rather than CFL bulbs. Assuming, then, that both types of bulbs are otherwise acceptable and that their users are rational, LED bulbs would be most likely to be used in such locations."

The manufacturer is considering switching from common salt to potassium chloride, because the by-product of the latter could be reprocessed to yield a crop fertilizer, with little waste left over to be disposed.\n\nReasoning: In order to determine whether it would be profitable to switch from using common salt to using potassium chloride, which answer choice does the manufacturer NOT need to answer? The chemical properties making potassium chloride an effective means of preserving animal hides might be quite different from those that make common salt effective, but there is no particular reason for thinking that this would impact the profitability of switching to potassium chloride. The relevant effects on the preserved hides might be the same even if the properties that brought about those effects were quite different. Thus, without more information than is provided in the passage, this question is irrelevant.\n\nWhy E is correct: Note that the question as stated here presupposes that potassium chloride and salt are both effective means for preserving animal hides—so it does not raise any issue as to whether potassium chloride is adequately effective or as effective as salt (clearly, an issue of effectiveness would be relevant to profitability)."

Since the type of colored diamonds that can be treated make up only 2 percent of all mined diamonds, and many diamonds of that type are too low in quality for treatment to be worthwhile, the vast majority of mined diamonds must not be treated to have their color removed. However, we are not told what proportion of all mined diamonds are naturally colorless. Naturally colorless diamonds may be far rarer even than the uncommon diamonds that have been treated to have their color removed. Thus, for all we can tell from the passage, it could well be that most colorless diamonds sold by jewelers have been treated to remove all color.\n\nWhy B is correct: The argument does not work if naturally colorless diamonds are rarer than treated diamonds, as they may be for all we can tell from the information provided."

Jay implies that by helping people live longer, expanding preventive medical care may actually increase the amount of urgent medical care people need over the course of their lives, and that societal expenses for this additional urgent care may equal or exceed any societal economic benefits from expanding preventive care. Sunil responds by implying that expanding preventive care would allow society to avoid economic losses from lost productivity caused by preventable illnesses.

That is why boreal owls range more extensively than do other, similarly sized owls in search of food.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice, if true, would most help confirm the proposed explanation? One way to confirm an explanation is by finding further information that one would expect to be true if the explanation is valid. If the explanation in the passage is valid, then one would expect that variations in the population density of available small-animal prey for boreal owls would be accompanied by variations in the ranges of the boreal owls. Naturally the population density of available small-animal prey is likely to be affected by how plentiful food is for those small animals.\n\nWhy B is correct: This indicates that abundance of food for the boreal owls’ small-animal prey in an area (and therefore abundance of small animals in that area) correlates with a smaller range for the boreal owls there.

The microbiologist reasons that because patients need prescriptions to obtain antibiotics in the country where the outbreak occurred, and the country’s doctors dispense such prescriptions less readily than doctors in other European countries do, antibiotics are probably not being overused in the country—so antibiotic overuse was probably not responsible for the outbreak. Implicit in the microbiologist’s reasoning is the assumption that overuse of antibiotics, if it had occurred, could probably have resulted only from overprescribing of antibiotics by physicians to treat illness in people in the country in question. Any evidence casting doubt on this complex assumption would suggest a weakness in the microbiologist’s reasoning.\n\nWhy B is correct: This weakens the microbiologist’s argument by indicating that an assumption implicit in the argument may be false: the salmonella outbreak could easily by explained by overuse of antibiotics in livestock feed (perhaps imported from other countries)."

But the economist suggests that the greater construction in mild winters than in harsh winters is not due to contractors prescheduling more construction during winters that are predicted to be mild. The economist says there are two reasons for this. One is that construction loans often need to be approved more than a year in advance.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice is logically most suited to be the second of the two reasons referred to by the economist? The economist seeks to explain why a forecast of an unusually mild winter does not result in an overall increase in construction scheduled to take place in upcoming winters. One reason suggested is that loan approval—and presumably financial planning—for a construction project might often need to take place at least one year in advance. However, forecasts a year in advance that a mild winter will occur are quite likely to turn out to be wrong. The unreliability of such forecasts would make it unwise to intentionally schedule greater amounts of construction for winters that may or may not turn out to be mild.\n\nWhy D is correct: The high likelihood that a forecast of a mild winter might turn out to be wrong is one reason for construction firms not to plan winter projects for areas where winters are usually harsh. This reason converges with the other reason provided: the forecast of a mild winter would have to occur up to one year in advance in order to obtain a loan approval in sufficient time to start construction."

The first four sentences of the passage simply provide background information. Both boldfaced sections are within the fifth sentence, which reports an argument by several scholars. The key word since indicates that the first boldfaced section is a premise in the scholars’ argument. A second premise preceded by another since follows in the next clause. The final clause of the fifth sentence reveals that the second boldfaced section is the conclusion of the scholars’ argument. In the sixth sentence, the historian expresses misgivings about the scholars’ conclusion, for reasons presented in the seventh and final sentence.\n\nWhy B is correct: The first boldfaced section is one of two premises in the scholars’ argument, and the second boldfaced section is that argument’s conclusion. In the following sentence the historian expresses reservations about that conclusion."

The passage says the sword maker seems to have created blades indistinguishable from historic Damascus blades by using iron with the same trace impurities found in those blades. But that does not prove the trace impurities are essential to the process. Evidence suggesting that Damascus blades have never been made from iron without the trace impurities would support the hypothesis that the trace impurities are essential to their manufacture.\n\nWhy D is correct: This suggests that when the historic sword makers lost access to the special iron with its trace impurities, they could no longer make Damascus blades. Thus, it supports the hypothesis that the trace impurities are necessary for manufacturing Damascus blades."

The argument implicitly assumes that advanced astronomical research can be accomplished more effectively with the more detailed, less distorted images produced by space telescopes and that therefore almost all advanced astronomical research will soon be conducted with space telescopes. This reasoning would be undermined by evidence that ground-based telescopes have substantial advantages for advanced astronomical research despite their distorted images or by evidence that space telescopes will not soon become common or affordable enough to support most advanced astronomical research.\n\nWhy E is correct: This indicates an inherent limitation of space-based telescopes: unlike Earth\u0002based telescopes, they lack the light-gathering capacity that astronomers need to perform one of their primary tasks, i.e., detailed spectral analyses. So Earth-based telescopes are unlikely to soon become obsolete."

But looser regulations and an improving economy will bring rapid development of new oil fields in the country.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice would most logically complete the argument? The passage describes the conditions that led to Utrania’s no longer being a major oil exporter: a lack of investment in new oil fields due to a stagnant economy and restrictive regulations. The passage then says that due to changed regulatory and economic conditions, there will now be rapid development of new oil fields. Nonetheless, this might not bring about an increase in Utrania’s oil exports. To logically complete the argument, one must explain how oil exports might not increase even when the condition that led to decreased oil exports has been removed. Suppose there were an increase in domestic oil consumption. A dramatic increase in the rate of car ownership in Utrania could reasonably be expected to significantly increase domestic oil consumption, which could eat up the added oil production from the new fields.\n\nWhy B is correct: An increase in car ownership would increase Utrania’s oil consumption—and this supports the claim that oil exports might not increase."

We are already informed that if Smee makes the change, it will eliminate the use of antibiotics in hog feed by farmers supplying at least 60 percent of the pork market.

Since the bollworms breed on corn, and there has been more corn planted this year in cotton-growing areas, the cotton is probably being overwhelmed by the corn-bred bollworms.\n\nReasoning: In evaluating the argument, which question would it be most useful to have answered? The argument states that the bioengineered cotton crop failures this year (1) have likely been due to the increased corn plantings and (2) not due to the pests having developed a resistance to the insecticide. This also implies (3) that the failures are not due to some third factor. It would be useful to know how the bioengineered cotton is faring in comparison to the rest of this year’s cotton crop. If the bioengineered cotton is faring better against the bollworms, that fact would support the argument because it would suggest that the insecticide is still combating bollworms. If, on the other hand, the bioengineered cotton is being more severely ravaged by bollworms than is other cotton, that suggests that there is some third cause that is primarily at fault.\n\nWhy B is correct: If bollworm damage on non-bioengineered cotton is worse than usual this year, then bollworm infestation in general is simply worse than usual, so pesticide resistance does not need to be invoked to explain the bollworm attacks on the bioengineered cotton."

If so, some factor other than positively charged smoke particles must affect the strikes’ charge."

The argument assumes that sales of different varieties of clematis at the nursery reflect the relative levels of popularity of those varieties among North American gardeners. It also assumes that jackmanii is the best-selling clematis variety at the nursery, an assumption which requires that less than 10 percent of the nursery’s clematis sales are of any one variety other than jackmanii.\n\nWhy A is correct: Suppose the nursery sold ten or fewer varieties of clematis. Then at least one variety other than jackmanii would have to account for at least 10 percent of the nursery’s clematis sales, so jackmanii would not be the best-selling clematis variety at the nursery as the argument assumes."

The psychologist reasons that the study shows a correlation between very high self-esteem and how highly one rates one’s social skills, and that this correlation in turn suggests that very high self-esteem improves social skills. This argument is vulnerable to at least two criticisms: First, the argument assumes that the volunteers’ ratings of their own social skills are generally accurate. But very high self-esteem might in many cases result from a tendency to overestimate oneself and one’s skills, including one’s social skills. Second, the argument fails to address the possibility that good social skills promote high self-esteem rather than vice versa, as well as the possibility that some third factor (such as a sunny disposition or fortunate circumstances) promotes both high self-esteem and good social skills.\n\nWhy C is correct: As explained above, very high self-esteem may often result from a tendency to overestimate oneself in general, and thus to overestimate one’s social skills."

But this is not a good strategy because the very high price of the new product only encourages competitors to match the technological advance more quickly.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice best describes the roles that the boldface portions play in the argument? This type of item concerns only the argument’s structure—the way it is intended to work, not the quality of the argument or what might strengthen or weaken the argument. So even if a boldfaced portion could be used by the argument in a certain way, all that matters is its actual intended role. The fact that technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed serves to partly explain why many companies charge the maximum possible price for such a product. In other words, the first boldfaced portion helps explain the popularity of the strategy presented in the second boldfaced portion. The conclusion of the argument, however, is that the strategy exemplified in this latter boldfaced portion is unwise, so the argument as a whole opposes that strategy.\n\nWhy C is correct: It is the only answer choice that is consistent with the analysis of the reasoning presented above."

A sharp reduction in the amount of grain directly consumed by meat eaters could compensate for increased meat consumption, making the conclusion false.

So, the average paycheck in the city has been increasing since Delmont took office.\n\nReasoning: Which answer choice, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument? If average pay for new jobs continually exceeds that for jobs generally, new jobs pay better (on average) than old jobs that still exist. But suppose the following occurred. Every year all of the highest paying jobs are eliminated and replaced with somewhat lower-paying jobs that still pay more than the average job. The result would be that every year the average pay for a new job would be greater than that for existing jobs, but the average pay for all jobs would nonetheless decrease. Thus, if every year during the mayor’s tenure the jobs that were eliminated paid better on average than jobs citywide, that would seriously weaken the argument: the conclusion could be false even if the information on which it is based is true.\n\nWhy C is correct: This information weakens the argument because it opens up the possibility that the jobs eliminated had higher average pay than the jobs created during Mayor Delmont’s tenure. This in turn would mean that the average pay was not increasing during Mayor Delmont’s tenure."

The critic reasons that to solve this problem, it will be necessary to encourage more young musicians to study classical music so that audiences will eventually be exposed to more talented classical performers and decide the genre is worthwhile after all. The argument would be weakened, for example, by evidence that hearing unremarkable live performances does not really drive many people away from classical music, or that the number of audience members hearing great performances does not depend much on the number of talented performers, or that encouraging young musicians to study classical music is either ineffective or not the only effective way to increase the number of talented classical performers.\n\nWhy C is correct: This suggests that classical music’s meager popularity could at least be maintained by encouraging people to listen to great old recordings of classical music rather than by increasing the supply of great live performances."

Suppose someone objected to the idea that this must be true for the plan to succeed by saying that, even if no one who received the coupon carpooled or used public transportation, congestion could still be reduced if enough other people carpooled or used public transportation. That is true, but in that case, it would not be the plan that succeeded. The goal would be accomplished, but it would have been accomplished without the plan itself being successful at accomplishing it."

Records of a Portuguese expedition to Benin in 1485 mention cast\u0002brass jewelry sent to Benin’s king from neighboring Ife.\n\nReasoning: What additional evidence, when combined with the argument’s premises, would most help support the conclusion that Benin’s knowledge of brass casting did not derive from the Portuguese? The argument is that since the expedition records indicate that cast-brass jewelry from Ife was already known in Benin when the Portuguese first came there, Benin’s knowledge of brass casting probably did not derive from the Portuguese. This argument assumes that receiving the brass-cast jewelry from Ife could have transmitted knowledge of brass casting to Benin, and also that knowledge of brass casting in Ife did not itself derive from the Portuguese. Any evidence supporting either of these assumptions would strengthen the argument.\n\nWhy B is correct: If the Portuguese had no contact with Ife before 1500, then Ife’s earlier knowledge of brass casting did not derive directly from the Portuguese. This increases the likelihood that knowledge of brass-casting in Benin did not derive from the Portuguese, even if it derived from Ife."

The economist concludes from this that if such emissions are to be reduced without stifling economic growth, there must be increases in governmental spending on research into energy technology.\n\nReasoning: What assumption is required by the economist’s argument? An obvious question to the economist’s argument is why an increase in governmental spending is required. Could nongovernmental spending alone not be at least as effective? If it could be, then the economist’s conclusion would not follow. Therefore, for the economist’s argument to be a good one, it would need to be true that nongovernmental spending alone would not be as effective for the intended purpose as increased governmental spending would be.\n\nWhy B is correct: As explained above, a natural response to the economist’s argument is to ask, “Why can we not just use nongovernmental spending to come up with new technologies that will allow us to restrain carbon dioxide emissions without stifling economic growth?” Without an answer to that question, the economist’s argument cannot be a good one. If answer choice B were true, it would bridge the logical gap by providing a reason that increased governmental spending—and not just nongovernmental spending—would be needed."

These groups are larger in late fall and winter, while group size decreases in spring, summer, and early fall, probably because of a seasonal difference in the mortality rate of young voles.\n\nReasoning: What provides support for the claim that increased mortality among young voles causes the annual reduction in vole group size observed in spring? If vole groups are large in late autumn and winter and much smaller during the rest of the year, then something must be causing the reduction in group size that occurs each spring through early autumn.

Therefore, identifying a likely cause of such increased seasonal mortality would support the explanation.\n\nWhy E is correct: If snakes that eat young voles are active in spring through early autumn, then that would support the explanation that increased mortality among young voles during the same period causes the seasonal decline in vole group size."

    "explanation": "Situation: The enzyme telomerase is produced by dividing cells. Therefore, it is not typically present in adult tissues, but there are two types of tissue that continue to show cell division in adults and thus are exceptions to this rule: bone marrow and cancer.\n\nReasoning: What is likely to be true if both bone marrow and cancer are exceptions to the general rule that telomerase is absent in adult tissues? The information suggests that telomerase is present in rapidly dividing cancer cells and also in healthy bone marrow cells, which divide continually because of their function of replacing blood cells. Since telomerase is expected in healthy bone marrow, it would not indicate that the bone marrow is cancerous.\n\nWhy C is correct: Since telomerase occurs normally in healthy bone marrow, its presence in bone marrow would not indicate cancer."

    "explanation": "Situation: Vebrol’s department heads are retiring in significant numbers. There are only about half as many qualified junior employees to fill the resulting vacancies. Vebrol will not hire department heads externally, have department heads lead multiple departments, or eliminate departments. For an unstated additional reason, some departments will lack department heads.\n\nReasoning: If the total number of qualified junior employees is only half of Vebrol’s projected need for department heads, and if Vebrol will not address that shortfall through external hiring, doubling department heads’ responsibilities, or eliminating departments, what additional factor would guarantee that some departments will be without department heads? If Vebrol will necessarily have departments without department heads, it follows that they are probably not using any means, including recruiting senior staff as department heads, to amend that projected shortfall.\n\nWhy C is correct: If Vebrol is ruling out an additional way to address the shortage of department heads—in this case, by not having senior employees serve as department heads—then that decision would logically ensure that some departments will not have heads."

    "explanation": "Situation: An ecologist points out that the common position is that human activity— primarily agriculture—led to the replacement of the formerly extensive forests of the Scottish Highlands by peat bogs. The ecologist points out several factors that cast doubt on this explanation and instead point to natural processes as the cause. The ecologist points out that agriculture began in the Highlands less than 2,000 years ago, that peat bogs build up at only about a foot per 1,000 years, and that the peat bogs throughout the Highlands are at depths greater than four feet. Finally, in support of the alternative explanation, the ecologist points out that climate changes that occurred 7,000 to 4,000 years ago would have favored peat bog development over forest survival.\n\nReasoning: What role do the two portions in boldface play in the ecologist’s argument? The ecologist rejects the common position that agriculture primarily accounts for the replacement of forests by peat bogs in the Scottish Highlands. The ecologist puts forward three main pieces of evidence as grounds for that rejection: that agriculture began in the Highlands 2,000 years ago (the first boldfaced portion), that peat bogs build up at one foot per 1,000 years, and that tree remnants in peat bogs throughout the Highlands occur at depths greater than four feet (the second boldfaced portion).\n\nWhy B is correct: The first boldfaced portion—which states that agriculture began in the Highlands less than 2,000 years ago—is used in the passage as grounds to reject the common explanation for the Highlands’ deforestation. That boldfaced portion serves as grounds for such a rejection in light of two claims, one stating that peat bogs build up at only one foot per 1,000 years, and the other—the claim made in the second boldfaced portion—that the remains of trees almost all occur at a depth greater than four feet, which would indicate that the deforestation occurred well before agriculture."
